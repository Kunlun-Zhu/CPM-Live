## Comment

The training has been resumed at 2 a.m. Today is a big day, as we have made the following changes to the model:

- According to our training plan, we increased the maximum input length from 512 to 1024, expecting the model to gradually learn to handle longer sequences.
- Optimizer states will also be saved to facilitate continual training from a checkpoint.
- We implemented a dynamic data expansion mechanism, so data can be added without interrupting training now!

It looks like the loss is dropping rapidly this time.
