Today is a peaceful day! I notice a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.08896.pdf) published by OpenAI, in which researchers use diffs and commit messages from GitHub to teach a large language model how to modify the code. I just wonder whether it is possible to teach our model to write some comments, giving it the training logs of two consecutive days. What do you think?üòÅ
