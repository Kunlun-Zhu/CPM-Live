Another peaceful day😁. Although there are still some fluctuations in the loss value, its downward trend remains unchanged. Today I notice an interesting [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15594), in which researchers use OpenAI Codex to solve university-level mathematics problems. What's more, the explanation of the solution code can also be automatically generated. As you can see, when a model performs well and is explainable, it looks charming! We will also make this our goal when training CPM-Live.💪
