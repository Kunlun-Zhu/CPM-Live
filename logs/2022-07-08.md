## Comment

Once again the loss has gone up! That's an interesting but probably reasonable result if you have seen our log for [this day](https://github.com/OpenBMB/CPM-Live/blob/master/logs/2022-06-22.md). That is to say, after learning from the data that has been seen many times, the loss of our model will return to the level it should be at.
