## Comment

The change in the training loss is currently in line with our expectations. A new model [NLLB](https://research.facebook.com/publications/no-language-left-behind/) is recently released by Meta. The model is multi-lingual and could translate between 200 languages. It is so cool and we wish CPM-Live could support more languages in the future.
