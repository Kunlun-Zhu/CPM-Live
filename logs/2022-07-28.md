Do you want to know everything about big models in the world? You've come to the right place again! 

Today we release **[BMList](https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMList)**, in which we include various key information about big models, such as the number of parameters, source code, relevant paper, released checkpoint and API. Currently, BMList covers big models in multiple domains, i.e. text, vision, audio and code. We'll continue to add more models!

**Contributions are welcomed!**
