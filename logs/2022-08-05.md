Successfully, the training of CPM-Ant has been completed! Here are our future plans:

1. The training of CPM-Ant comes into a new stage, and the model will evolve into CPM-Ant+. In this stage, we will learn from more data and extend new features beyond CPM-Ant. All these efforts will be released as CPM-Ant+ and also contribute to our next model, CPM-Bee.

2. We are preparing a brief conclusion of the CPM-Ant training and a poll for expected features of CPM-Bee, which will be released next week.

3. For the final release of CPM-Ant, we will need around a month to evaluate and compress our model. The final release will include a technical report, the final model (also with compressed versions), as well as interesting demos. They are expected to be open in early September 2022!

So stay tuned and CPM-Live will always be running!
